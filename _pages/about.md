Thanks for visiting my page!

I am a PhD student at the [Vision and Perception Neuroscience Lab](http://vpnl.stanford.edu) working with [Dr. Kalanit Grill-Spector](https://psychology.stanford.edu/people/kalanit-grill-spector) at Stanford University. Broadly, I am interested in understanding the development of visual perception and cognition. I hope to contribute to this topic using neuroimaging and computational modeling methods. 

I am experienced with running different kinds of neuroimaging studies (such as fMRI and EEG), and using analysis tools (MRICron, Cluster computing, NILearn, Python, MATLAB) to understand the data.

Previously, I graduated from Johns Hopkins University with BA in Cognitive Science and BA in Medicine, Science and Humanities. As an undergrad, and later as a post-bac lab manager, I worked with [Dr. Leyla Isik](https://www.isiklab.org/) on investigating the neural development of social interaction perception. I also worked with [Dr. Michael McCloskey](https://cogsci.jhu.edu/directory/michael-mccloskey/) on understanding developmental dysgraphia. I also led an independent project looking at the effects of visual feedback on letter stroke direction in handwriting. I have also worked with [Dr. Moira Dillon](https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/Moira-Dillon.html) at NYU on children's understanding of 2D and 3D space drawings, and [Dr. Janice Chen](https://jchenlab.johnshopkins.edu/) at JHU on event boundary coding of naturalistic movie data.

In my free time I like to read books, write creative nonfiction, play tennis, explore the city, and hike :)
