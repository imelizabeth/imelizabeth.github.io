Hi, I am an aspiring cognitive scientist and a writer! Currently, I am working as Dr. Leyla Isik's lab manager. I am interested in visual neuroscience and social cognition. Here, I have been investigating the neural development of social interaction perception in children as young as three. I have experience with running different kinds of neuroimaging studies (such as fMRI and EEG), and using analysis tools (MRICron, Cluster computing, NILearn, Python, MATLAB) to understand the data.

Before joining Isik Lab, I graduated from Johns Hopkins University with a B.A. in Cognitive Science and B.A. in Medicine, Science and Humanities. As an undergrad, I mainly worked with Dr. Michael McCloskey in the Cognitive Science Department (JHU), and worked on understanding developmental dysgraphia. I also led an independent project looking at the effects of visual feedback on letter stroke direction in handwriting. Other cool researchers I have had the opportunity to work with as an undergraduate who helped form my research interests include Dr. Janice Chen (JHU) and Dr. Moira Dillon (NYU).
