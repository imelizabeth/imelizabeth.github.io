You found my page! I am an incoming first year PhD student at the Computational Cognitive Neuroscience Lab (PI: Dr. Leyla Isik) at Johns Hopkins University. My research interests are visual perception and social cognition. I hope to contribute to our understanding of social vision using neuroimaging and computational modeling methods. 

I am experienced with running different kinds of neuroimaging studies (such as fMRI and EEG), and using analysis tools (MRICron, Cluster computing, NILearn, Python, MATLAB) to understand the data.

I have BA in Cognitive Science and BA in Medicine, Science and Humanities from Johns Hopkins University. As a lab manager and a post-bac researcher, I worked with Dr. Isik on investigating the neural development of social interaction perception. As an undergrad, I mainly worked with Dr. Michael McCloskey on understanding developmental dysgraphia. I also led an independent project looking at the effects of visual feedback on letter stroke direction in handwriting. I have also worked with Dr. Moira Dillon at NYU and Dr. Janice Chen at JHU.

In my free time I like to read books, write creative nonfiction, play tennis, explore the city, and hike :)
