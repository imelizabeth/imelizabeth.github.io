abstract = {Many behavioral studies have demonstrated that children have advanced social perception and reasoning abilities from an early age. On the other hand, the neural development of such abilities is still poorly understood, due to the challenges of acquiring brain imaging data from young children using traditional neuroimaging methods. To address this gap, we use fMRI data collected while children and adults watched an engaging and socially-rich Pixar movie ‘Partly Cloudy’ to investigate how the social processing neural activity changes during development. We labeled the movie with visual and social features, including motion energy, presence of a face, presence of a social interaction, theory of mind (ToM) events, and valence and arousal. Using a voxel-wise encoding model—which has previously shown to explain unique variances in social processing regions—trained on these features, we find that the model can predict neural activity in both children and adults. In addition, we find that separate models based on visual (motion energy) or social (faces, interaction, ToM, valence, and arousal) features can predict brain activity in children as young as 3.5 years old in both MT and STS. Furthermore, models trained on individual social features showed that while SI features were similarly predictive in STS in all age groups, ToM features continued developing through adulthood, suggesting SI recognition is a relatively early developing ability. The current study, for the first time, links the developmental neural changes to the stimulus-driven social features in a movie.}
